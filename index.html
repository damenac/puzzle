<p>The adoption of <strong>language-oriented software development</strong> relies on the availability of the DSLs needed to express all the aspects of a system under construction. This implies the development of many DSLs which is a challenging task due to the specialized knowledge and skills it requires. As a matter of fact, the ultimate value of DSLs has been severely limited by the cost of the associated tooling (i.e., editors, parsers, etc) <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-11617-4_1">[Jézéquel:2015]</a>. </p>

<p>To improve cost-benefit when using DSLs, the research community in software languages engineering has proposed mechanisms to increase reuse during the construction of DSLs. The idea is to leverage previous engineering efforts and minimize implementation from scratch <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10009-010-0142-1">[Krahn:2010]</a>. These reuse mechanisms are based on the premise that <strong>“software languages are software too”</strong> <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-19440-5_21">[Favre:2011]</a> so it is possible to use software engineering techniques to facilitate their construction.</p>

<p>In particular, there are approaches that take ideas from Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) and Software Product Lines Engineering (SPLE) during the construction of new DSLs. Indeed, the notion of <strong>language product line</strong> (a software product line where products are languages) has been recently introduced <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-12107-4_7">[Zschaler:2010]</a>. We are facing an emerging approach in the construction of DSLs: Language Product Lines Engineering (<strong>L-PLE</strong>).</p>

<p>The figure below illustrates how the Software Product Lines Engineering approach can be adapted to the construction of software languages, in particular DSLs, by supporting <strong>Languages Modularization</strong> and <strong>Languages Variability Management</strong>. </p>

<p>In practice, however, reuse is not necessarily achieved by means of monolithic processes where language designers defined language modules and variability models while trying to predict that they will be useful in the construction of feature DSLs. Rather, the exploitation of reuse is often an iterative process where reuse opportunities are discovered during the construction of individual DSLs in the form of replicated functionalities that can be extracted as reusable language modules. </p>

<p>We propose an approach to build language product lines by means of <strong>reverse-engineering processes</strong> that permit to extract reusable language modules from legacy DSLs as well as to synthesize variability models to capture commonalities and particularities. Figure below presents the overall approach. We take as an input a set of legacy DSLs (in our case, implemented under the executable metamodeling paradigm). Then, we reverse-engineering a set of language modules, as well as a variability model. Such variability model can be used for language designers to configure, and derive, DSLs according to their needs. </p>

<p>Puzzle is a set of tools intended to support reverse engineering of language product lines. So far, Puzzle provides: (1) reverse-engineering of reusable language modules from a given set of DSLs; and (2) reverse-engineering strategies for synthesizing feature models capturing the corresponding variability. Puzzle is still under construction, however. Currently, we are integrating to Puzzle the composition operators we need to the derivation process. </p>
