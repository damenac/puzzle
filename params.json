  "body": "### Language Product Lines Engineering in a Nutshell\r\nThe adoption of **language-oriented software development** relies on the availability of the DSLs needed to express all the aspects of a system under construction. This implies the development of many DSLs which is a challenging task due to the specialized knowledge and skills it requires. As a matter of fact, the ultimate value of DSLs has been severely limited by the cost of the associated tooling (i.e., editors, parsers, etc) [[Jézéquel:2015]](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-11617-4_1). \r\n\r\n  To improve cost-benefit when using DSLs, the research community in software languages engineering has proposed mechanisms to increase reuse during the construction of DSLs. The idea is to leverage previous engineering efforts and minimize implementation from scratch [[Krahn:2010]](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10009-010-0142-1). These reuse mechanisms are based on the premise that **“software languages are software too”** [[Favre:2011]](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-19440-5_21) so it is possible to use software engineering techniques to facilitate their construction.\r\n\r\nIn particular, there are approaches that take ideas from Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) and Software Product Lines Engineering (SPLE) during the construction of new DSLs. Indeed, the notion of **language product line** (a software product line where products are languages) has been recently introduced [[Zschaler:2010]](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-12107-4_7). We are facing an emerging approach in the construction of DSLs: Language Product Lines Engineering (**L-PLE**).\r\n\r\nThe figure below illustrates how the Software Product Lines Engineering approach can be adapted to the construction of software languages, in particular DSLs, by supporting **Languages Modularization** and **Languages Variability Management**. \r\n\r\n<img src=https://github.com/damende/puzzle/blob/master/website-sources/lple.jpg?raw=true width=520 height=240 />\r\n\r\nSimilarly to software product lines, language product lines can be built through two different approaches: top-down and bottom-up [[Kuhn:2016]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2934470). In the top-down approach, a language product line is designed and implemented through a domain analysis process where the knowledge owned by experts and final users is used to define a set of language modules that implement the language features of the product line. Also, the domain knowledge is used to specify variability models capturing the rules that define the way in which the language features can be combined to produce valid DSL variants. In the bottom-up approach, the language product line is built up from a set of existing DSL variants through reverse-engineering techniques. Those techniques should provide mechanisms for: (1) recovering of a language modular design including all the language constructs existing in the DSL variants; and (2) synthesis of the corresponding variability models.\r\n\r\n### Contributions\r\n\r\nBased on these different approaches for the construction of language product lines, we propose two contributions briefly explained below:\r\n\r\n#### A top-down perspective for L-PLE\r\n\r\nAs a first contribution, we introduce a set of facilities to support the development of top-down language product lines. Concretely, we provide a language modularization approach that permits the decomposition of DSLs into interdependent language features. We also introduce a modeling strategy to represent the variability of a language product line. These facilities are accompanied with a set of methodological insights to guide language designers during the development process. \r\n\r\n#### A bottom-up perspective for L-PLE\r\nAs a second contribution, we introduce a reverse-engineering process to automatically build up a language product line from a set of existing DSL variants. This process encompasses: (1) the recovering of a language modular design that defines the features of the language product line; and (2) the synthesis of variability models that represent the corresponding variability.\r\n\r\n<img src=https://github.com/damende/puzzle/blob/master/website-sources/reverse-engineering.jpg?raw=true width=520 height=240 />\r\n\r\n#### Scope\r\n\r\nAll the ideas that we will present in the remainder of this thesis are scoped to executable domain-specific modeling languages (xDSMLs) where the abstract syntax is specified through _metamodels_, and the dynamic semantics is specified operationally as a set of _domain-specific actions_ [[Combemale:2013]](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-36089-3_11). Domain-specific actions are java-like methods that introduce behavior in the meta-classes of a given metamodel. Such injection is performed via weaving as the same as in aspect oriented programming [[Jezequel:2015]](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10270-013-0354-4). Concrete syntax, and hence concrete syntax variability, are out of the scope of this thesis. \r\n\r\n### Puzzle: A top supporting language product line engineering\r\nPuzzle is a set of tools intended to support language product line engineering by consider both the top-down and the bottom-up approach.
