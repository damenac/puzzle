 CDO supports real-time collaboration on models by transferring the changes that one user
 <a href="../../javadoc/org/eclipse/emf/cdo/transaction/CDOTransaction.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.emf.cdo.transaction"><code>commits</code></a> to the repository to all
 other users connected to the same repository and transparently weaving those changes into their model copies.
 <p align="center"><img src="collaborating.png"></p>

 <p>
 With CDO the local model copies (in particular with <a href="Doc04_CheckingOut.html#Doc_TransactionalCheckouts" title="Chapter in CDO Model Repository Documentation">online transactional checkouts</a>) do not need to be
 <i>updated</i> manually; they are automatically updated (almost) at the time they are changed by other users.
 <p>
 As real-time collaboration relies on committing a <a href="../../javadoc/org/eclipse/emf/cdo/transaction/CDOTransaction.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.emf.cdo.transaction"><code>transaction</code></a> it applies only to
 online transactional checkouts and the <a href="Doc07_UsingModels.html#Doc_EditingModelElementsEditor" title="Chapter in CDO Model Repository Documentation">editors</a>
 opened on online transactional models. Saving a model editor commits the underlying transaction.
 <p>
 The data integrity of the models and model elements in a repository is guaranteed by <a href="../../../org.eclipse.net4j.util.doc/javadoc/org/eclipse/net4j/util/concurrent/IRWLockManager.LockType.html" title="Class in org.eclipse.net4j.util.concurrent.IRWLockManager"><code>write locks</code></a>
 that are acquired <b>per model element</b>. <a href="../../../org.eclipse.net4j.util.doc/javadoc/org/eclipse/net4j/util/concurrent/IRWLockManager.LockType.html" title="Class in org.eclipse.net4j.util.concurrent.IRWLockManager"><code>Read locks</code></a> and <a href="../../../org.eclipse.net4j.util.doc/javadoc/org/eclipse/net4j/util/concurrent/IRWLockManager.LockType.html" title="Class in org.eclipse.net4j.util.concurrent.IRWLockManager"><code>write options</code></a>,
 as well as <a href="../../javadoc/org/eclipse/emf/cdo/view/CDOView.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.emf.cdo.view"><code>durable locks</code></a> are supported by the core-level APIs
 but not by the CDO Explorer's user interface.

<h2><a name="Doc_OptimisticLocking"></a>1&nbsp;&nbsp;Optimistic Locking</h2>
<p>
 By default model elements are locked optimistically, that is, the CDO server <i>implicitly</i> acquires and releases locks while executing
 a commit operation. These implicit locks are not visible to the committing user or any other user of the same repository.
 <p>
 Optimistic locking provides for the highest possible degree of concurrency but it also comes with a non-zero risk of commit conflicts
 that are only detected when a commit operation is executed by the CDO server and, as a consequence, rejected. Because of
 <a href="Doc08_Collaborating.html#Doc_EarlyConflictDetection" title="Chapter in CDO Model Repository Documentation">Early Conflict Detection</a> the risk of conflicts that are detected that late in the commit process is generally much lower
 than, for example, in pure database-based applications.
 <p>
 To completely eliminate the risk of commit conflicts <a href="Doc08_Collaborating.html#Doc_PessimisticLocking" title="Chapter in CDO Model Repository Documentation">Pessimistic Locking</a> must be used.

<h3><a name="Doc_EarlyConflictDetection"></a>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Early Conflict Detection</h3>
<p>
 As the local model copies of a user are automatically updated (almost) at the time they are changed by other users
 CDO can anticipate the conflict potential of the local changes early, in particular before an attempt to commit these changes is even made.
 The <a href="Doc07_UsingModels.html#Doc_EditingModelElementsEditor" title="Chapter in CDO Model Repository Documentation">CDO Model Editor</a> decorates such conflicting model elements with a red-colored font,
 indicating that the underlying <a href="../../javadoc/org/eclipse/emf/cdo/transaction/CDOTransaction.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.emf.cdo.transaction"><code>transaction</code></a> can not be successfully committed anymore.
 <p align="center"><img src="early-conflict.png"></p>

 <p>
 <a href="Doc08_Collaborating.html#Doc_AutomaticConflictResolution" title="Chapter in CDO Model Repository Documentation">Automatic Conflict Resolution</a> and <a href="Doc08_Collaborating.html#Doc_InteractiveConflictResolution" title="Chapter in CDO Model Repository Documentation">Interactive Conflict Resolution</a>, if enabled, may have an impact on what exact types
 of changes are considered a conflict.

<h3><a name="Doc_AutomaticConflictResolution"></a>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic Conflict Resolution</h3>
<p>
 Each time a local transaction is notified of a remote change by the CDO server and local conflicts are detected (see <a href="Doc08_Collaborating.html#Doc_EarlyConflictDetection" title="Chapter in CDO Model Repository Documentation">Early Conflict Detection</a>)
 these conflicts are categorized as being either <i>trivial</i> conflicts or <i>non-trivial</i> conflicts. Trivial conflicts are:
 <ul>
 <li> Changes to multi-valued EStructuralFeature features on both sides (local and remote) of the same model element.
 <li> Changes to different single-valued EStructuralFeature features on both sides (local and remote) of the same model element.
 </ul>
 <p>
 Trivial conflicts are merged automatically into the local transaction, i.e., no user interaction is involved.
 <p>
 When non-trivial changes are detected, i.e., changes to the same single-valued EStructuralFeature feature on both sides (local and remote)
 of the same model element, automatic conflict resolution is suspended for all model elements until the next local commit operation.
 During this period all incoming change notifications are accumulated and remembered for possible <a href="Doc08_Collaborating.html#Doc_InteractiveConflictResolution" title="Chapter in CDO Model Repository Documentation">Interactive Conflict Resolution</a>
 at commit time.

<h3><a name="Doc_InteractiveConflictResolution"></a>1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Interactive Conflict Resolution</h3>
<p>
 If <a href="Doc08_Collaborating.html#Doc_AutomaticConflictResolution" title="Chapter in CDO Model Repository Documentation">Automatic Conflict Resolution</a> has detected non-trivial conflicts in a local <a href="../../javadoc/org/eclipse/emf/cdo/transaction/CDOTransaction.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.emf.cdo.transaction"><code>transaction</code></a> and
 an attempt is made to commit this transaction the following dialog pops up:
 <p align="center"><img src="late-conflict.png"></p>

 <p>
 The dialog shows an overview of how many local model elements are added, changed, and removed. One of several conflict resolution
 actions has to be selected by the user:
 <ul>
 <li> If the Merge action is selected an EMF Merge editor is opened with the left side showing the remote changes and
      the right side showing the local changes:
      <p align="center"><img src="merge.png"></p>

      <p>
      Saving this merge editor commits the merged local transaction. Note that new non-trivial conflicts may have been detected
      in the meantime, in which case interactive conflict resolution is triggered again.
 <li> If the Rollback action is selected the local transaction is <a href="../../javadoc/org/eclipse/emf/cdo/transaction/CDOTransaction.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.emf.cdo.transaction"><code>rolled back</code></a> and the local model copies
      are automatically updated to their latest remote versions. As a result all local changes will be lost and eventually need to be
      re-applied and committed again.
 </ul>

<h2><a name="Doc_PessimisticLocking"></a>2&nbsp;&nbsp;Pessimistic Locking</h2>
<p>
 Sometimes it seems not desirable to risk commit conflicts as they can occur with <a href="Doc08_Collaborating.html#Doc_OptimisticLocking" title="Chapter in CDO Model Repository Documentation">Optimistic Locking</a>.
 In these cases CDO supports the acquisition of <i>explicit</i> locks on selected models (see <a href="Doc08_Collaborating.html#Doc_TreeLocking" title="Chapter in CDO Model Repository Documentation">Tree Locking</a>) and model elements.
 <p>
 Pessimistic locking support consists of:
 <ul>
 <li> Lock and unlock actions
 <li> Lock state visualization
 </ul>
 <p>
 Whether custom user interface components, such as model editors or views, support local actions and/or lock state visualization depends
 on the implementation of those components. The CDO Model Editor's context menu offers lock actions for model elements that are not locked
 by anyone and unlock actions for model elements that are locked by the current user. Both the CDO Model Editor and the
 <a href="Doc01_UserInterface.html#Doc_ProjectExplorerIntegration" title="Chapter in CDO Model Repository Documentation">Project Explorer Integration</a> support lock state visualization by decorating model elements that are locked by the current user
 with a green lock icon (indicating that they can be modified) and model elements that are locked by other users with a red lock icon
 (indicating that they can not be modified):
 <p align="center"><img src="pessimistic-locking.png"></p>

 <p>
 Note that a CDO editor generally operates in the context of a separate transaction, in particular not in the context of the
 <a href="../../javadoc/org/eclipse/emf/cdo/view/CDOView.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.emf.cdo.view"><code>read-only view</code></a> of the associated checkout, which explains why, in the screen shot above, both checkouts show the
 locked model elements with a red lock icon decoration. In other words, while a model element is locked in a CDO editor it can not be
 modified directly in the associated checkout via the Project Explorer.

<h3><a name="Doc_TreeLocking"></a>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Tree Locking</h3>
<p>
 Sometimes it is desirable to lock not just a single model element but to atomically lock the tree of model elements rooted at the
 selected model element. The CDO Model Editor's context menu offers a Lock Tree action for model elements that are not locked by
 anyone and an Unlock Tree action for model elements that are locked by the current user.

<h2><a name="Doc_AutomaticLocking"></a>3&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic Locking</h2>
<p>
 With automatic locking turned on for a particular <a href="../../javadoc/org/eclipse/emf/cdo/transaction/CDOTransaction.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.emf.cdo.transaction"><code>transaction</code></a> write locks are automatically acquired
 for model elements at the time these model elements are modified the first time.
 <p>
 Automatic locking is not yet supported for checkouts.

<h2><a name="Doc_AutomaticCommitting"></a>4&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic Committing</h2>
<p>
 With automatic committing turned on for a particular <a href="../../javadoc/org/eclipse/emf/cdo/transaction/CDOTransaction.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.emf.cdo.transaction"><code>transaction</code></a> that transaction is automatically committed
 each time a model element is modified. This can be very useful when the primary purpose of a repository is to support real-time
 collaboration between a number of users.
 <p>
 On the other hand with automatic committing multiple logically related changes are no longer
 isolated in single composed commits. This  can be especially undesirable in repositories with auditing or branching support
 because the databases of these types of repositories monotonously grow with the number of commits.
 <p>
 Automatic committing is not yet supported for checkouts.
