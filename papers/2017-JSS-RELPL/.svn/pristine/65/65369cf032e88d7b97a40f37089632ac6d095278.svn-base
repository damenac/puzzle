\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this article we presented a reverse-engineering process that allows to automatically produce a language product line from a set of existing DSLs. Our reverse-engineering process starts by breaking down the DSLs into a set of reusable language modules. Then, the process goes through the synthesis of the models that capture the variability existing among the extracted language modules.
