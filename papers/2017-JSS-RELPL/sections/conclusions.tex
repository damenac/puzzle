\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this article we presented an approach to support the construction of bottom-up language product lines. Our approach consists of a reverse-engineering process that allows to automatically produce a language product line from a set of DSL variants. Such reverse-engineering process starts by recovering a language modular design, and then produces variability models that permit configuration of new variants. We validate our approach in a case study on different DSL variants to express finite state machines.
